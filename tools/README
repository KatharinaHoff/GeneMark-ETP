Programs in this folder are third-party tools used in the GeneMark-ETP project.

Programs are compiled with static library linking when such linking is possible.
See details in the INSTALL.details file.

ATTENTION
Several options in "samtools" that are not required by ETP 
are switched off during compilation (to allow static linking).

To check if programs are executable on your platform, please run
   ./check_ETP_tools.pl
